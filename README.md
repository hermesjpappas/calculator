## Welcome to CALC9000+!
This is an exercise for The Odin Project for bringing HTML, CSS and JS together.
I learned some interesting things about the power of regular expressions through this.
Overall, quite a fun project!

## Instructions:
<p>Click the buttons with your mouse, or:</p>
<p>* or x to multiply, + to add, - to subtract or for negative numbers, / to divide.</p>
<p>C or Delete to clear, Backspace for correcting smaller errors.</p>
<p>Enter for =. Use your numpad or regular numbers/operators.</p>
<p>NOTE: CALC9000+ rounds results down to three decimal points for simplicity.</p>
